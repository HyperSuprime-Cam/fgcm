List of fundamental updates since the FGCM paper.  This does not include
general code improvements and streamlining, which are a given.

- LUTs are now generated per CCD per atmosphere (rather than as a delta on top
  of the standard)
- LUTs now include a dI1 term for smoother interpolation in the I1 LUT
- g band SED approx formula updated
- aperture corrections included
